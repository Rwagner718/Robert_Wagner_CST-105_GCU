 *(ThePerson,Student,Employee,Faculty,andStaffclasses) Design a class named 
Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.Make Faculty and 
Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, 
and email address. A student has a class status (freshman,sophomore, junior, 
or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, 
salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 
10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours 
and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each 
class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
